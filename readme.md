# Components Viewer

## Project Description

This project is part of HÃ¸yskolen Kristiania's assignment focused on creating an interface to view <b>8 different UI components</b> and their various states. The design system allows users to toggle between additive rendering (showing multiple components at once) or solo rendering (displaying one component at a time).

The webpage is responsive and works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Features

- Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Component States: Displays each component in multiple states, including default, hover, active, and disabled.
- Toggle View: Switch between additive and solo rendering modes for flexibility.
- Minimal and Modern Design.
